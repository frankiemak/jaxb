Suggestion:

1.	String format for message printing to console/file.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/925423/is-it-better-practice-to-use-string-format-over-string-concatenation-in-java
"Hello %1$s the time is %2$t"
               String.format("Hello %1$s, your name is %1$s and the time is %2$t", name, time)

-	Benefits – localisation, what if the message changes,ableto be controlled by properties file




2.	Program structure – a suggestion
a.	Applpication in one folder – program change if need to 
b.	Properties config by one folder – properties/config change just when need to
c.	A program becomes program + properties, i.e.. rate – DTT_premiumrate = program + config
d.	Scenario acould be there is no program change, program at v1.0 and properties changed, i.e. business given a new rates excel, hence the excel input file name to the program changes.
e.	CI/CD – the CI/CD tool, just pickup the last deployed version to production, deploy the new config/properties, re-run the junit (trigger during maven build or afterwards). And vice-versa, when only program changed, i.e. the logic to how to decode a rate table, let’s say.

f.	Externalise resources from the jar. i.e. the rate excel table. To allow the structure of 

g.	Program in one older, config/properties in one folder.
